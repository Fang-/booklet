### Android

* The broker connection works well with:

  * No TLS (i.e. plain)
  * TLS with Android system certificate authorities
  * TLS with side-loaded user-provided self signed certificate authorities 
  * TLS with client certificates
  * Username/password authentication to broker.

* Automatic publishes at configurable maximum intervals under the condition that the devices moved the specified number of meters. Publishes may occur earlier if a new location is avaiable. 

* Display of a marker at which the app believes the user to be at
  (lastKnownLocation)

* Reverse geo coding that displays the address of lastKnownLocation

* Accuracy of lastKnownLocation 

* Button to manually publish lastKnownLocation



### iOS

* Runs on iPhones and iPads as an iPhone app. Not tested on iPods.

* Monitors "significant location changes" as defined by Apple Inc. (about 5 minutes AND 
  	"significant location changes" (>500m)) or as described in Move Mode below.
	In addition version >= 5.3 supports circular region monitoring (aka geo fences).
	In addition version >= 7.7 supports iBeacon region monitoring and ranging.

* publishes this locations via MQTT to the configured server while in foreground and background.

* The current location can be sent (a.k.a. published) on request.
