## Quicksetup Extras

There are some additional features of [Quicksetup](../guide/quicksetup.md) we describe here.

## MQTT

During bootstrapping _quicksetup_ creates a user for the MQTT broker with additional permissions. Specifically, the user `_lr` is permitted to publish in `owntracks/#`: the idea is that this user can, for instance, be used to clear other users' OwnTracks topics, etc.

The password for this user is randomly generated and stored in a file in the _userdata_ directory. The following invocation can be used from the command line:

```console
$ mosquitto_pub -u _lr -P "$(cat /usr/local/owntracks/userdata/.lr.pw)" ...
```

## Files

- in `/usr/local/owntracks/userdata`
      - `.lr.pw` is a file containing the password for the MQTT user `_lr` that is permitted to publish to `owntracks/#`
      - `htpasswd` is a file containing hashed passwords for logging into your OwnTracks web site; each user has such a password which matches the random password generated for MQTT
      - `recorder.pw` is a file containing a password with which the Recorder connects to your MQTT broker.
      - `*.pass` are the generated (or set) passwords for users you configured in `configuration.yaml`
      - `*.otrc` are the generated [otrc](remoteconfig.md) files for users configured in `configuration.yaml`.

- in `/usr/local/owntracks/lego`
      - are configuration files created / generated by _lego_, the Let's Encrypt enroller/renewer

- in `/usr/local/owntracks/tls`
      - contain TLS keys and certificate for your configured `dns_domain`
- in `/usr/local/owntracks/ansible`
      - is where `bootstrap.sh` installed Ansible, which is used by the bootstrapper
