## OwnTracks apps

The OwnTracks apps operate in one of two modes (discussed in [scenarios](scenarios.md)), and you tell the app in which mode you want to use it.

In MQTT mode, you configure our iOS and Android app to access your broker, and in HTTP mode you do similarly but with an HTTP endpoint.
